# Sometimes, we have to check whether a given number a is within the range b and c (where b  c, and both inclusive ).

# checks whether a is within the range of b and c by calling the method range 
# (which we have defined for you as a method for this example) on a and 
# passing b and c as arguments.

a.range?(b, c)
